        &nbsp;&nbsp;When obtaining plasmid DNA for digestion and ligation, a yield of at least 15 ng/μL is desirable. 
        Also, it is helpful to miniprep more than one sample of each type of plasmid DNA every time the miniprep 
        procedure is done. Due to the overnight incubation step, minipreps are a bottleneck process, so minimize the 
        number of times you perform minipreps. Another benefit of having a large volume of DNA is that you have the 
        option of concentrating the DNA if needed.</p>
    </div>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Digest the plasmid DNA for the two parts with the appropriate enzymes for the desired ligation.</strong></p>
    <p><b>2.1</b> If you are digesting with EcoRI and PstI to verify the size of an insert, use 12 μL of miniprep DNA, 
    or at least 400 ng. If digesting to make a vector or an insert, the amount of DNA to digest depends 
    how much DNA you need for your ligation.<br /><br /></p>

    <p><b>2.2</b> Mix the DNA with 2 μL of the appropriate buffer (see Table 1) in a 500-μL microfuge tube. Add 1 
    μL of each enzyme (total enzyme volume cannot exceed 10% of reaction volume). Increase the volume 
    to 20 μL with dH2O.Salt conditions for double digestion. Useful enzyme combinations for digesting 
    BioBrick parts with their optimal buffer and what the digestion produces. All five reactions are 
    optimal at 37°C<br /><br /></p>

    <p><b>5.1</b> Place 50 ng of digested vector, 5 μL of ligation buffer, and 1 μL of T4 ligase into 
    a 500-μL microfuge tube. The amount of insert to add is calculated from the following 
    formula:<br /><br /></p>
    <p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;ng of insert=(2)(bp\ insert)(50ng linearized plasmid)/ (size of plasmid in bp).<br /><br /></p> 
    <p><img class="image" src="..\static\img\protocol\5.png" align="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;Add water to increase the final volume to 10 μL.<br /><br /></p>
    <p><b>5.2</b> Prepare both a positive ligation mixture that contains the digested vector and insert 
    as well as a negative ligation mixture that contains only the digested vector. Add more 
    water to the negative ligation mixture to prepare equal volumes.<br /><br /></p>
    <p><b>5.3</b> Leave the ligation mixture at room temperature for 5 min, and then use it directly for 
    transformation of E. coli competent cells, or store it by freezing until transformation.
    <br /><br /><br /></p>
</div>
<div class="content" id="tab6"><br />
    <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the ligation mixture to transform into competent E. coli cells.</strong></p>
    <p><b>6.1</b> Prewarm culture plates to increase the drying rate of plated cells. The culture plates 
    should contain the appropriate antibiotic for the transforming plasmid.<br /><br /></p>
    <p><img class="image" src="..\static\img\protocol\6.png" align="right"><b>6.2</b> Store Z-Competent™ cells at −70°C or colder. Thaw a 100-μL tube of Z-Competent™ 
    cells for 5 min on ice. At the same time, cool the tubes containing the ligation mixtures 
    on ice.<br /><br /></p>
    <p><b>6.3</b> Very gently add 25–50 μL of Z-Competent™ cells to each ligation mixture of 10 μL.<br /><br /></p>
    <p><b>6.4</b> Let the mixtures incubate on ice for 5 min.<br /><br /></p>
    <p><b>6.5</b> Add SOC media with no antibiotic to a final volume of 60–100 μL/tube. For plasmids 
    using the ampicillin resistance marker, the cells will begin repairing their cell walls immediately 
    and are ready to be plated. For plasmids with other antibiotic resistance markers, incubate 
    without shaking for 20 min before plating.<br /><br /></p>
    <p><b>6.6</b> Spread the cells on culture plates containing the appropriate antibiotic. Let the plates 
    incubate overnight until colonies are visible and large enough to pick individually.<br /><br /></p>
    <p><b>6.7</b> If transformation with Z-Competent™ cells is unsuccessful, traditional heat-shock transformation 
    or electroporation with a different brand of competent cells may yield higher efficiencies.

    <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;After overnight incubation of the transformed cells, pick colonies from the ligation and the control plates for colony PCR to quickly test if the ligation was successful in any of the colonies.</strong></p>
    <p><b>7.1</b> Compare your positive ligation plate to your negative ligation plate to estimate the number of 
    background negative colonies. Plan to screen an appropriate amount so that it is highly probable 
    at least one of the positive colonies will have the correct insert size given the amount of background 
    negative colonies. Screen at least one negative colony also.<br /><br /></p>
    <p><img class="image" src="..\static\img\protocol\7.png" align="right"><b>7.2</b> To conduct PCR, you will need a forward and reverse primer specific to the plasmid being screened. 
    The primers should amplify the region where the insert was added.<br /><br /></p>
    <p><b>7.3</b> For each colony to be picked, prepare a PCR tube with the following mixture: 
    12 μL 2× Green Master Mix, 10 μL dH2O, 1 μL (20 pmol) forward primer, 1 μL (20 pmol) 
    reverse primer.<br /><br /></p>
    <p><b>7.4</b> Use a micropipette tip to pick a single colony off of the culture plate. Place the tip into 
    a labeled PCR tube and mix by pipetting up and down.<br /><br /></p>
    <p><b>7.5</b> Remove 1 μL of the PCR mixture and place it in a labeled test tube containing 200 μL 
    culture media with antibiotic to reserve some of the cells from the colony to grow later. 
    Incubate these cultures at 37°C.<br /><br /></p>
    <p><b>7.6</b> Conduct the following PCR cycle: 95°C for 10 min, followed by 20 cycles of 95°C for 
    15 s, 46°C (or appropriate annealing temperature for your primers) for 15 s, 72°C for 
    60 s/kb of DNA of the expected size for a successful DNA ligation.<br /><br /></p>
    <p><b>7.7</b> Run the reaction products on an agarose gel appropriate for the size of the amplified product. 
    You can use our gel optimization tool to choose the appropriate percent agarose. 
    Colonies containing unsuccessful ligations will have the same insert size as the negative control 
    colony. Successful ligations will be bigger than the negative control insert size. For 
    colonies that show the expected insert size, save the corresponding culture and discard all 
    unsuccessful colonies.<br /><br /></p>
    <p><b>7.8</b> The BioBrick part can be further verified by miniprepping and digesting and gel electrophoresis, 
    or by sequencing. After successful ligation and transformation, the part can be used or 
    manipulated more to construct more new parts.<br /><br /><br /></p>
